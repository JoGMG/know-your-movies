## Risks

### Technical Risks

- **Data Accuracy**: Inaccurate data may misinform users.
  - *Preventive Measures*: Use multiple data sources and encourage user feedback for data validation.

- **Scalability**: As data increases, the server and database must scale accordingly.
  - *Preventive Measures*: Implement load balancing to handle server performance.

### Non-Technical Risks

- **Negative User Reviews**: Negative experiences can lead to poor reviews.
  - *Preventive Measures*: Ensure data accuracy and address user complaints promptly.

- **User Experience**: Lack of language support can frustrate users.
  - *Preventive Measure*: Implement language translation features.

## Infrastructure

### Branching and Merging Process

We follow the GitHub Flow, a lightweight, branch-based workflow for efficient collaboration and code deployment. The key steps include:

1. Create a Branch
2. Add Commits
3. Pull Request (PR)
4. Review and Discussion
5. Merge
6. Delete Branch

This workflow ensures collaboration, code quality, and correctness.

### Deployment Strategy

We implement Continuous Deployment (CD) where code changes are automatically deployed to production after passing automated tests.

### Data Population Strategy

Data is sourced from various places, including API integration, the site's database, and user-generated data through reviews.

### Testing Tool

We employ Unit Testing to ensure individual software components perform as intended.

## Existing Solutions

We are similar to existing movie-related websites like IMDb, The Movie Database, Rotten Tomatoes, and Metacritic in that we provide cast information and encourage user reviews. However, our focus on movie casts simplifies the user experience by providing precise information without unnecessary complexity.
